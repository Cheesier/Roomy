Roomy lets you define rooms or houses, even towns if you want to.
Creating events when a player enters the room/house/town, or making a room/house/town behave different from the rest of the world.
Such as losing items on enter, triggering checkpoints or whatever you can think of to use it with.

Roomy is still in development, but can be used if desired.
